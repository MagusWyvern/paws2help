Paws2Help ("we", "us", "our") is operated by **ADI AHMAD DANISH**.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal data when you use the Paws2Help progressive web application (PWA), including its website features and app-like functionality.

By using Paws2Help, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 4. Personal Data We Collect

Based on current implementation, we may collect the following categories of data.

### 4.1 Account and authentication data

When you sign in through Firebase Authentication (including Google sign-in and other enabled providers such as Facebook or email/password), we may receive and store:

- Firebase user ID (`uid`)
- Name/display name
- Email address
- Profile photo URL (if provided by your sign-in provider)
- Account metadata from Firebase (for example account creation timestamp)

- Name you enter (`creatorName`)
- Phone number you enter (`creatorPhone`)
- Pet image URL you enter (`petImage`)
- Listing type preference (`donate`)
- Map coordinates you submit (`coords`)
- Reverse-geocoded address (`addressName`)
- Your user ID (`uid`)
- Creation timestamp (`createdAt`)

### 4.3 Stray animal report data you submit

When you submit a stray report, we store:

- Animal type
- Estimated count
- Region description
- Map coordinates
- Your user ID (`uid`)
- Creation timestamp (`createdAt`)

### 4.4 Chat and messaging data

When you use in-app chat, we store conversation and message data including:

- Participant IDs
- Listing reference details (e.g., listing ID/address)
- Listing owner label/name used in chat context
- Message sender ID and sender name
- Message content
- Message/conversation timestamps
- Last message preview metadata

### 4.5 Technical and service data

We and our service providers may process technical data required to operate the service, such as:

- Basic device/browser/request metadata
- Authentication/session state required to keep you signed in
- Cached resources used by the PWA service worker for offline/performance behavior

## 5. How We Collect Data

We collect data:

- Directly from you when you create an account, sign in, create listings, submit reports, or send messages
- Automatically through app functionality needed to run the service (for example authentication persistence and caching)
- From integrated providers used to deliver core features

## 6. Why We Use Your Data

We use personal data to:

- Provide and operate Paws2Help features
- Authenticate users and maintain account sessions
- Display and manage pet listings and stray reports
- Enable messaging between users
- Enforce security controls and prevent abuse
- Maintain, debug, and improve reliability/performance
- Comply with legal obligations

## 7. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We use third-party infrastructure to provide Paws2Help. Your data may be processed by these providers as needed to deliver service functionality:

- **Firebase (Google)**: Authentication and Firestore database services
- **Netlify**: App hosting/deployment
- **OpenStreetMap tile services**: Map rendering
- **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)**: Reverse geocoding from coordinates to address labels
- **Cloudflare CDN**: Serving Workbox library used by service worker logic

We do **not** currently use a payment provider in Paws2Help.

We do **not** sell your personal data.

We may disclose data if required by law, legal process, or valid government request.

## 8. Cookies, Local Storage, and Tracking

Current implementation does not include ad-tech trackers or marketing pixels.

However, essential browser storage/technologies may be used to run the app, including:

- Firebase authentication persistence (to keep users signed in)
- Service worker/browser cache for PWA/offline behavior

These are used for core functionality, not behavioral advertising.

## 9. Data Retention

We keep personal data only for as long as needed to provide the service and legitimate operational/legal purposes.

Current behavior:

- Users can delete listings and stray reports from their account area
- Users can request account deletion from the account area
- Account deletion removes the authentication account, but does not guarantee automatic deletion of all related records (for example chat history) unless separately processed

For complete data deletion requests, contact us by email and we will process requests within the response timeline stated in this policy, subject to technical and legal constraints.

Some limited technical logs/backups may remain temporarily in provider systems according to provider retention cycles.

## 10. Your Rights and Requests (Malaysia)

For users in Malaysia, you may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data by emailing:

- **maguswyvern@gmail.com**

Target response time: **within 14 working days**.

Where available, you may also perform deletion actions directly from your account page.

## 11. Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including platform-level controls such as authenticated access and Firestore security rules to restrict unauthorized access.

No internet transmission or storage system can be guaranteed 100% secure. If you discover a security issue, please report it to:

- **maguswyvern@gmail.com**

## 12. International Processing

Although this service is intended for Malaysia users, some providers may process or store data in infrastructure located outside Malaysia.

By using Paws2Help, you understand that cross-border processing may occur as part of normal service delivery.

## 13. Links and External Content

Paws2Help may link to external services or user-supplied content (for example image URLs). We are not responsible for third-party privacy practices or content.

## 14. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

When we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above and publish the revised policy in the app/website.

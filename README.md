## Paws2Help: A Fundamental Endeavour to Support Stray Animals

It is a common sight to see many stray animals roaming around the city, looking for food, water, or even shelter. Most of them have often been overlooked, given only at most a simple pat from strangers. Since they may be infected with dangerous diseases and a wide range of the animals do not have a pleasant appearance, society chose to move further away from them causing them to continue to be neglected. 

This web app aims to help the community aware of how many stray animals are in their vicinity. Along with features to list unwanted animals or pets for people that are looking to be pet owners.

## To-do

- [ ] File Structure<br>
The file structure is currently being reorganized, but it'll follow your standard `/scripts/`, `/styles/` and so on.

- [ ] Javascript Framework Integration<br>
While it is possible to not use any framework, I plan to integrate a bit of Vue to help me manage components of the web app and so on

- [ ] Firebase Automatic Build Pipeline<br>
Currently I'll need to manually deploy a build folder to firebase, unlike Netlify. 

## Builds

Netlify automatically builds the web app from each new commit to the main branch, but Firebase builds will need to be buit and deploy manually

> All builds use the files in the `/public/` directory!

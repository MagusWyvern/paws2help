## File Structure 

The file structure is currently being reorganized, but it'll follow your standard `/scripts/`, `/styles/` and so on.

## Builds

Netlify automatically builds from each commit to the main branch

Firebase builds will need to be build manually

> All builds use the files in the `/public/` directory
